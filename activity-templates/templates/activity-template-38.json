Some job boards focus on a particular industry or interest — like healthcare or sales — while others focus on a particular location. \n\nJob search boards are incredibly useful for connecting companies and recruiters with job seekers. Here’s how to get the most out of them and how to avoid scams."

The work-from-home position that allows you to make up to $100,000 a year with no skills or degrees necessary is likely a scam. Look up the company in the Better Business Bureau, and find reviews on sites like Yelp.",
