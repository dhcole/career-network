And there’s no supervisor to enforce a deadline.\n\nSetting a daily routine can help you feel more organized and less overwhelmed. It can also help you enjoy other aspects of your life, so the job search doesn't take over your whole day. You can be confident that you have a plan. \n\nIt may take some trial and error to find a routine that works for you. Be patient with yourself as you try different approaches."
