To improve your chances of catching a recruiter’s attention, take the time to customize your cover letter for each role you apply to."

Because of my passion for this artform, I’m applying for the makeup artist position at Studio 96.\n\nI’ve served in several customer service positions since I graduated high school, in which I’ve honed my people skills, increased upsales by 17%, and improved my ability to work effectively in high-pressure situations.\n\nHowever, I’ve found that customer service doesn’t satisfy my creative side. Thus, I’m eager to join Studio 96, a company I’ve been a fan of since I learned the avant-garde approach to makeup application developed under your founder Bianca Del Vanjie.\n\nTo meet Studio 96’s needs, I’ve completed the 150-hour course in Makeup Artistry offered by the Los Angeles-based Sonique Academy in my spare time. I’ve also volunteered for the Look Good, Feel Better organization, where I boosted the self-esteem of patients with cancer by giving them makeovers.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing back from you. I can be reached at 555-876-653 or lacey.r.jones@gmail.com. Thank you for considering my application.\n\nSincerely,\nLacey Jones"
