LinkedIn is a great place to focus your efforts if you want to grow your network and get a job. \n\n<b>Differences between LinkedIn and your resume</b> \nYour resume is a good starting point for filling out the experience section (for more information on updating your resume, visit the Resume milestone). There will be a lot of overlap, since both items list your experience and key skills. \n\nHowever, it’s best not to treat your LinkedIn profile as a place to copy your resume and do nothing else. On LinkedIn, you can show off more of your personality, connect with relevant jobs, and share examples of your work. \n\n<b>Getting the most out of LinkedIn</b>\nTo get the most out of LinkedIn, fill out the whole profile. One study found that job applicants in a wide range of industries were 71% more likely to get an interview if they had a comprehensive LinkedIn profile. (Source: ResumeGo)\n\nBelow are tips for each LinkedIn section and some help for writing your headline — one of the most important parts of your profile.
