For example, a recent graduate may want to place education at the top of their resume. Other people may want to highlight relevant job experience first. \n\nTo show your most relevant experience, you will likely need to customize your resume for different job applications. But it’s a good idea to have a master resume that you can use as a starting point for each application."
