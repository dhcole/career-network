This isn’t just a silly game — doing this exercise can give you a new perspective on your job search. \n\nImagine that there’s a new Jobs section on LinkedIn or Indeed. Instead of organizations posting what they want in job applicants, you get to post what you want in a job. If an employer thinks that they can provide a role that meets your requirements, they can apply."
