In my last role, my team exceeded the monthly quota by 15% for two years in a row and landed three of the largest accounts in company history.\n\nGiven my experience and expertise, I am seeking a salary in the range of $75,000-80,000. However, I am open to discussing alternative compensation, such as opportunities for additional stock options or increased performance-based bonuses. (Source: Indeed.com)"
