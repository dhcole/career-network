Then let your interests guide you toward promising job roles. \n\n<b>Balancing short-term needs and long-term wants</b>\nIf you’re worried about how to put food on the table, it’s hard to think about anything but finding a job, any job. And maybe that’s what you need to do for now. \n\nBut long-term, it can be helpful to know where you want to end up. Clearly identifying your job interests — the work you want to do, skills you want to use, and the projects you want to work on — can improve your search strategy. \n\n<b>Finding your path</b>\nBy defining the work you ultimately want, you’ll be better positioned to recognize jobs that can help you get there. And maybe offer some of what you’re looking for in the meantime."
