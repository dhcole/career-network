But we can help.\n\nLet’s talk about why it’s important to network in the first place. Experts estimate that as many as 4 out of 5 people landed their current job because of someone in their network. (Source: Payscale.com) People like to hire people they know and trust. \n\nA strong networking pitch is an important tool for growing your network. A good pitch is a memorable description of what you do or what you're good at. You can use your pitch to start conversations during virtual networking events or interviews — basically any time you want to make a professional impression."
