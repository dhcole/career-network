And others — like overeating or ignoring a problem — can actually make things worse.\n\nBenefits of healthy coping skills\nHealthy coping skills help you feel better in the moment. But they can also help you bounce back more quickly when things go wrong — meaning that coping skills make you more resilient in the long run.\n\nRight now, we’re all facing a lot of uncertainty and added stress during the pandemic. If you’re also out of work, as many people are, that can make this national time of uncertainty even more challenging. \n\nPlanning ahead\nWhen we’re feeling stressed, it can be hard to think of what to do for ourselves. So today we’re going to focus on healthy coping strategies. \n\nYou’ll have the opportunity to think about the actions that help you cope and make a list to keep handy."
