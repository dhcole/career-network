Because of my passion for this artform, I’m applying for the makeup artist position at Studio 96.\n\nI’ve served in several customer service positions since I graduated high school, in which I’ve honed my people skills, increased upsales by 17%, and improved my ability to work effectively in high-pressure situations.\n\nHowever, I’ve found that customer service doesn’t satisfy my creative side. Thus, I’m eager to join Studio 96, a company I’ve been a fan of since I learned the avant-garde approach to makeup application developed under your founder Bianca Del Vanjie.\n\nTo meet Studio 96’s needs, I’ve completed the 150-hour course in Makeup Artistry offered by the Los Angeles-based Sonique Academy in my spare time. I’ve also volunteered for the Look Good, Feel Better organization, where I boosted the self-esteem of patients with cancer by giving them makeovers.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing back from you. I can be reached at 555-876-653 or lacey.r.jones@gmail.com. Thank you for considering my application.\n\nSincerely,\nLacey Jones","Items":[{"Id":"nVwVa","Content":null,"ItemNumber":1}],"Variant":null,"ListHeading":null,"ListSubheading":null,"ItemNumber":2},{"Id":"Z6HUC","Type":"Text","Content":"Example #2 (Source: The Balance Careers)\nDear Mr. Smith,\n \nI was thrilled to see your ad for an occupational therapist at Citytown Therapy.
