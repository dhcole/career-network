Or you may want to seek out someone specific.\n\nIn one survey, more than 7 out of 10 executives said that mentoring played a key role in shaping their career. (Source: Forbes) \n\nSome companies offer formal mentoring programs for their employees. In one of these companies, employees who had mentors were 5 times more likely to get promoted than those who did not have a mentor. (Source: Sun Microsystems) \n\nA mentor is different from a supervisor. \nA supervisor is a boss or manager whose role is to make sure you're meeting the company’s goals. They can hire and promote you. \n\nA mentor isn’t usually in a position to hire or promote you. Their role is to provide a space for you to learn, grow, and ask questions.",
