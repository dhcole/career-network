But we can help.\n\nLet’s talk about why it’s important to network in the first place. Experts estimate that as many as 4 out of 5 people landed their current job because of someone in their network. (Source 1: Payscale.com) People like to hire people they know and trust.\n\nA strong networking pitch is an important tool for growing your network. A good pitch is a memorable description of what you do or what you're good at. You can use your pitch to start conversations during virtual networking events or interviews — basically any time you want to make a professional impression.",

Marketing is the career for me, because I thrive on being creative and client focused, and I enjoy using these skills to grow revenue. I have studied your company, and I’m drawn to your culture of constant innovation. I would be a strong match for this opportunity.” (Adapted from Source 2: Saylordotorg)\n\nContext: Email following an online webinar \n“Hi Rick, thank you for speaking during the New Human Resources webinar. I learned so much from your ideas about keeping morale high in a remote work environment. With a background in business and Human Resources, I’m passionate about learning how to create the right environment to make people work the most effectively. I’d love to get a chance to speak more with you. Are you available to chat next Wednesday?”",
